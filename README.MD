Simple neural network implementation in javascript, following this excellent series : neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

I reimplemented everything from scratch in order to get a better understanding. Although it kinda works, it is extremely inefficient (matrix math is pretty ugly), and take a loooooot of time to train.

Gets around 97% for MNIST.

Added a canvas to draw numbers and let the trained network take a guess.
